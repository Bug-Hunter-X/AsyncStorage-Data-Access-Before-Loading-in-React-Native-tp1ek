This error occurs when using AsyncStorage in React Native and trying to access the data before it's fully loaded. This often happens when a component mounts before the data is fetched from AsyncStorage.  The solution involves using the `useEffect` hook and the `await` keyword to ensure the data is fetched before the component renders.
