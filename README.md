# AsyncStorage Data Access Before Loading in React Native

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native when accessing AsyncStorage data before it has fully loaded, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes.  The solution showcases the proper use of `useEffect` and `await` to ensure data is fetched before the component renders.

## Problem

Accessing AsyncStorage data immediately after component mount may result in undefined values, leading to errors or unexpected UI behavior.  This example shows a component that attempts to access stored data without waiting for it to be loaded.

## Solution

The solution uses the `useEffect` hook and `await` to ensure the data is fetched and available before the component renders.  This prevents accessing AsyncStorage data before it is ready.
